Greetings from AlphaEdge team!
Welcome to our blog. Please spend a few minutes with us getting a glimpse of our project, goal and current progress.
Our team is working on the project of “Bitcoin futures trading strategy based on Natural Language Processing (NLP)”. This is a classroom project of our university course **_Text Analytics and Natural Language Processing in Finance_**. Our goal is to derive a quantitative trading strategy of **bitcoin futures contract** based on bitcoin textual data analysis.
Till now, we have finished collecting data and preprocessing data, we would like to share our experience in this blog and hope this could be useful if you have interests in similar projects!
